# loguru makes logging very easy
# What's really good about loguru is that it is a friendlier form end to the Python standard logging facilities. 
# So you can easily drop back to standard logging is loguru does not meet all your needs.

# To get started
pip install loguru 

# import
from loguru import logger

# all you need to do to do logging is
logger.debug("Message to go in the log")
